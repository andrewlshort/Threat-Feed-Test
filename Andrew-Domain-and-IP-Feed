This is intended to be a Domain Threat Feed for XGS Firewall SFOS 21.5

1.1.1.1
rumplestiltskin.com

The intention is to see the threat feed ingest both IPs and domains via the domain type feed.

2.3.4.5
6.7.8.89
123.123.123.123
applebrownbetty.com
40.50.60.80

Also watch the threat feed dutifully ignore the free text comments I've inserted, like this one, that don't parse to either an IP address or a domain name.

4.5.6.7
downwithtrolls.com

Here's an idea - will it ingest a URL too?
